        "To do a shoulder press, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold dumbbells at shoulder height with your palms facing forward. Press the dumbbells up and overhead, then lower them back down to the starting position. Repeat for your desired number of reps. Aim to do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.",
        "The proper form for a shoulder press involves keeping your elbows close to your body, your wrists straight, and your back straight. Make sure to engage your core and use a weight that you can lift with proper form.",
        "It's best to start with a lighter weight and gradually increase as you get stronger. Aim to do 3 sets of 8-12 reps."
